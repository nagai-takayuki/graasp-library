## Getting Started

To run this app locally you need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org) and
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) installed on your operating system. We strongly recommend that you
also have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). All the commands that you will see here use `yarn`,
but they have an `npm` equivalent.

Download or clone the repository to your local machine, preferably using [Git](https://git-scm.com).

### Installation

Inside the project directory, run `yarn` to install the project dependencies.

You will also need to create a file called `.env.local` with the following contents.

```dotenv
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=
```

In order to ensure that you can contribute and test, also create a file called `.env.test`.
You can leave this file empty.

### Running Locally

Navigate to the cloned or forked project directory using the command-line, then type `yarn start`.
The app will automatically run on `localhost:3000`. Any changes you make should be automatically
rendered in the browser.

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the project in development mode.  
You can view your application at `http://localhost:3000`

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run start:prod` or `yarn start:prod`

Runs the compiled app in production.

You can again view your application at `http://localhost:3000`

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher (Jest) in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

### `npm start -- --inspect` or `yarn start -- --inspect`

To debug the node server, you can use `razzle start --inspect`. This will start the node server and enable the inspector agent. For more information, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/).

### `npm start -- --inspect-brk` or `yarn start -- --inspect-brk`

To debug the node server, you can use `razzle start --inspect-brk`. This will start the node server, enable the inspector agent and Break before user code starts. For more information, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/).

### `rs`

If your application is running, and you need to manually restart your server, you do not need to completely kill and rebundle your application. Instead you can just type `rs` and press enter in terminal.
